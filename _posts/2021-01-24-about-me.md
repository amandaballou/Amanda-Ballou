I am a member of Alpha Delta Pi and the Campus Activities Board.  My roommate took this course last semester and recommended it to me.  I am an indecisive person who can barely choose what candy to get at the movies let alone my future job, but I am tentatively pursuing a career in writing.  This interest is what spurred me to take the course, since it will introduce me to different forms of writing.

Last year, I volunteered with Innovative Minds at the Boys and Girls Club.  This club planned science experiments to both entertain and teach the kids.  I enjoyed volunteering with them, but the pandemic has made it difficult to continue to volunteer. 

While I do enjoy writing, I have also thought a lot about a career as an English teacher at a high school level.  Like I previously mentioned, I am fairly indecisive, which is why I chose CNU.  It is a good place to explore my options, which is kind of what I am doing in this course.  

One cool fact about me is that I work at [Cold Stone Creamery](https://www.coldstonecreamery.com/cakes/signaturecakes/index.html).  I have worked there for over three years.  It is a fun place to work because I love my coworkers, and I am a major sweet tooth.  My favorite ice cream is mint chocolate chip, but cotton candy is a close second.  The best part of the job is building and decorating cakes.  I am not very artistic, but I am very proud of my cake decorating and writing skills.  

While I attended high school in Mechanicsville, Virginia (near Richmond), I have also moved around a lot.  When I was very young, I lived in New York.  I lived in Florida up until halfway through fifth grade when I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia where I went to a Catholic middle school.  I attribute my love for the beach to my growing up in Florida and practically living at the beach every weekend.  After middle school, I moved to Mechanicsville, VA.  

I have two sisters of which I am the youngest.  My sister, Michaela, lives in Los Angeles.  My other sister, Caroline, is a senior at George Mason University.  I have had multiple family dogs, but I am more of a cat person.  My cat, Ava, is almost 6 months old.  She is absolutely crazy and goes around hitting my dogs and playing in the curtains.

I look forward to growing my writing skills and exploring the field of digital humanities.  While I do like social media, I do not have much (if any) experience with Twitter, so bear with me and my terrible Tweets.

#Letâ€™s have a great semester!
