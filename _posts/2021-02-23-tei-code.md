# Diving into TEI 

by Amanda Ballou 

### *Introduction* 
I was assigned a portion in the manuscript version of “The Yellow Wall-paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson to code by using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, a program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML).  “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a short story published in 1892 about a woman’s descent into madness.  It is a representation of the attitudes towards women’s mental health during the 19th century.

### My Part 
I was assigned to code page 8-11 of the manuscript version.  This section deals mainly with her inner thoughts.  She ruminates on the titular “yellow wallpaper” as well as her husband, John.  This passage is important to the story because it shows her descent into madness through her obsessive thoughts on the wallpaper.    

To be honest, I did not think about what my section was about until I started writing this blog.  While I was coding, I was very focused on the TEI aspects of what needed to be marked up/coded rather than the literary aspects.  I think this is because I was very nervous that I would miss something crucial to the code.    

### Google Doc Exercise 
In the Google Doc, our text was copied into it from the manuscript.  This really helped me because transcribing the handwriting into Google Docs would have been very difficult since Stetson’s handwriting can be challenging to read at times.

We were in charge of marking instances such as page beginnings, paragraphs, weird spacing, em-dashes, underlined words, crossed out words, and mistakes in the text.  I got a bit confused during this part because I wanted to mark things that didn't quite make sense to me.  For example, on page 8, there is a particularly confusing sentence that states “It was nursery first, and then playroom and gymnasium, I should judge…” (Stetson).  Her word choice was unfamiliar to me, and I had to read the sentence again to realize that it did in fact make sense.    

The Google Doc exercise was a good stepping stone into using Oxygen.  It created a sort-of cheat sheet to look at when inputting the text into Oxygen.  I have a lot of experience in Google Docs, so it was very familiar and easy to use the add comments feature.

### Using Oxygen 
Marking up the Google Doc was one thing, and Oxygen was a different thing.  Thankfully, the crash course in class on Wednesday the 17th helped me to understand more of how to code in Oxygen.  Additionally, my CPSC 115 class went over HTML tags extensively, so I was very familiar with the different tags.  HTML tags are similar to the XML tags used in Oxygen.

Later that night, I was able to code my section into Oxygen.  My biggest problem was not actually Oxygen-related.  While I usually use multiple tabs on my computer screen, Oxygen minimizes to an extreme.  Therefore, I had to continuously flip back and forth between Oxygen, the Google Doc, and the TEI Tags sheet on the website.

I did have minor issues with Oxygen that I was able to solve on my own.  I had never coded an em-dash before.  Even though it was the easiest instance to code, my em-dash code still kept flagging as red, which means the code would not work.  I finally realized my mistake.  I had forgotten the semicolon at the end of the string.  It was a dumb mistake, but I look back at it and laugh.

### Conclusion
Overall, I think I was successful in my coding of pages 8-11.  While I did get frustrated at times, I was proud of my work at the end.  Initially, I did not understand how coding fit into Digital Humanities.  Through this project, I now understand that it forms the foundation of all DH projects.  I feel a lot more comfortable with coding than I did to start with, and I look forward to learning more about tagging and the overall system.
