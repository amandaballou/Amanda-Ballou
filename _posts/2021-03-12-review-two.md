### *Summary*

*Bomb Sight* is a compilation of data from WWII Bomb Census Maps between October 7th, 1940 and June 6th, 1941 in London.  The project director’s aim is to show what it was like in London during the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids.  The Blitz is associated with a period of continued aerial bombing by the Germans on Britain.  This data has been brought to life in an interactive way showing maps, images, and memories throughout London.

### *Design and Data*

The map was created with Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.org.  Leaflet allows for the interactive map UI.  The Bomb Census Maps, previously only available in The National Archive (TNA), are the primary data source in the creation of the project.  These maps were specifically from material collected during the Bomb Census Survey 1940-1945. 

The images were taken from the Imperial War Museum, while the memories were taken from BBC history.     

### *Humanistic Claims*

*Bomb Sight* does a fantastic job of compiling data and inputting it into an interactive and new way to explore what it was like during the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids in London.  It is a way to keep history alive while increasing accessibility and widening the audience, since these maps were previously only available in the Reading Room of the National Archives.  

### *Findings*

The site opens to the map.  The map is easy to navigate.  By clicking the question mark symbol, users are able to view a map key that shows the types of bombs that dropped.  The map also features an information symbol that shows the purpose of the project as well as a how-to guide to using the map.  This feature is beneficial for people who may not be as technologically savvy to understand the site.

The map can be changed by clicking on the layers button next to the question mark.  Users can look at the map in satellite or street map view.  They can also change the map to look like a 1940s version.  This is a cool feature since it shows what an actual map during the time looks like, while also showing bomb sites.

The map can also be changed to show different categories of data.  Users can look at a map of the aggregate bomb census, the first night of the Blitz, or the weekly bomb census.  The First Night of the Blitz map has a graph that shows the number of bombings as the night went on.  The Weekly Bomb Census has a similar graph that shows the number of bombings daily.  These graphs could be more clear with labelled axes.

The map features a search bar where users can look up specific streets or locations.  This is a cool idea because it enhances the usability of the site.  However,  this feature is not consistent.  It does not always load correctly or at all.

The different bombs can be clicked on to show more information concerning the bomb and the location it dropped.  It opens to a new page with the details of the bombing as well as nearby memories and images.  This feature is important for the project’s purpose since it re-creates history through the memories and images.

*Bomb Sight’s* clarity could be improved by creating a home screen that showcases the purpose of the project as well as a simple description of the data and time period.  This would help to increase understanding of the project.   

The site can be navigated by using the three-lined box in the top right.  The About tab focuses on the project’s features and purpose.  It explains the different types of applications including a web-mapping with responsive mode, as well as an Android Mobile Phone application with augmented reality.  While this is an informational page, the images do not load.

It is on this page that the project designers add a message on the usability of the project.  They admit that it has been designed for use on the most current versions of Chrome, Internet Explorer, and FireFox, so there may be functionality issues on other browsers.  This admission is honest and helps explain any possible issues (i.e the images not loading) that may arise. 

The Explore London tab allows users to click on specific areas in London and view statistics for those areas.  It also shows images and memories relating to the area.  This feature is beneficial for those who aren’t able to use the map.

The Data tab gives a list of the data involved in the project.  The FAQ tab goes into more depth about the data.  It is beneficial for those wanting to understand the data behind the project, since it explains the selection process.

While I don’t have access to the Android app, the website is mobile-friendly.  This is largely due to the responsive mode of the website, which allows the website to resize seamlessly, so it functions on different sized screens.

Overall, the project is eye-opening and informative.  It caters to all audiences regardless of experience-level and does a great job showing the scope of the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids in London.  The memories and images work efficiently to explore the history of their respective locations.
