### *Summary*

*Bomb Sight* is a compilation of data from WWII Bomb Census Maps between October 7th, 1940 and June 6th, 1941 in London.  The project director’s aim is to show what it was like in London during the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids.  The Blitz is associated with a period of continued aerial bombing by the Germans on Britain.  This data has been brought to life in an interactive way showing maps, images, and memories throughout London.

### *Design and Data*

The map was created with Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.org.  Leaflet allows for the interactive map UI.  The Bomb Census Maps, previously only available in The National Archive (TNA), are the primary data source in the creation of the project.  These maps were specifically from material collected during the Bomb Census Survey 1940-1945. 

The images were taken from the Imperial War Museum, while the memories were taken from BBC history.     

### *Humanistic Claims*

*Bomb Sight* does a fantastic job of compiling data and inputting it into an interactive and new way to explore what it was like during the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids in London.  It is a way to keep history alive while increasing accessibility and widening the audience, since these maps were previously only available in the Reading Room of the National Archives.  

### *Findings*

The site opens to the map, which is easy to navigate.  By clicking the question mark symbol, users are able to view a map key that shows the types of bombs that dropped.  The map also features an information symbol that shows the purpose of the project as well as a how-to guide to using the map.  This feature is beneficial for people who may not be as technologically savvy to understand the site.

The map can be changed by clicking on the layers button next to the question mark.  Users can look at the map in satellite or street map view as well as a 1940s version.  his is a cool feature since it shows what an actual map during the time looks like, while also showing bomb sites.

The map can also be changed to show different dates and times.  The First Night of the Blitz and the Weekly Bomb Census have graphs that shows the number of bombings as the night went on.  These graphs could be more clear with labelled axes.

The map's search bar feature enhances the usability of the site.  However,  this feature is not consistent and does not always load correctly or at all.

The different bombs can be clicked on to show more information concerning the bomb and the location it dropped.  It opens to a new page with the details of the bombing as well as nearby memories and images.  This feature is important for the project’s purpose since it re-creates history through the memories and images.

The site is easy-to-navigate, yet its clarity could be improved by creating a home page that showcases the purpose of the project as well as a simple description of the data and time period.  This page would help to increase understanding of the project that is missing since it opens to the map with no description.

The About tab is informational, yet the images do not load.  On this page, the project designers add a message on the usability of the project.  They admit that it has been designed for use on the most current versions of Chrome, Internet Explorer, and FireFox, so there may be functionality issues on other browsers.  This admission is honest and helps explain any possible issues (i.e the images not loading) that may arise. 

The Explore London tab is beneficial for those who aren’t able to use the map since it offers a different way of exploring the information.

The Data and FAQ tabs are beneficial for those wanting to understand the data behind the project, since it explains the selection process.

While I don’t have access to the Android app, the website is mobile-friendly.  This is largely due to the responsive mode of the website, which allows the website to resize seamlessly, so it functions on different sized screens.

Overall, the project is eye-opening and informative.  It caters to all audiences regardless of experience-level and does a great job showing the scope of the WWII Luftwaffe Blitz bombing raids in London.  The memories and images work efficiently to explore the history of their respective locations.
