# Grant Process/Reflection Blog

by Amanda Ballou

### *Introduction* 
My proposed project, *Mapping Power of the Dog*, is based on the novel of the same name minus “Mapping,” written by Don Winslow.  This book is based on three decades of the US War on Drugs, which was a campaign led by the US federal government with the aim of reducing the illegal drug trade in the US.  Winslow shows this war using a massive character list and allusions to actual historical events.  My project will map the characters’ pathways as well as the historical events.  Additionally, it will provide context for the War on Drugs and historical events.

I put together this idea after reading Raphael Folsom’s “Brainstorm within Your Subject,” in which he explains the best place to start is your coursework.  I knew that I wanted to do a mapping project, but I did not know what to map.  I read *Power of the Dog* in ENG 304, a class based on the narco-novel, and I absolutely loved it.  When looking back through my coursework, I realized that I could make this book into a mapping project that educators and scholars could use to study the book and historical framework.  

### *Starting Off*
As someone who loves reading and studying literature, I was excited to be creating a framework for studying literature from a different perspective.  Mapping literature provides a more physical, interactive way to study the text that caters to people with different learning styles.      

While I was passionate about this project, I did not know where to start with the Environmental scan.  I had a long list of scholarly information regarding the war on drugs, but I could not find similar DH projects that mapped literature, since it’s a relatively new and undiscovered field.  A quick meeting with Dr. Stover helped me find more readily-available projects that I could still relate to my project.  These projects mapped real-life crime, while my project maps fictional crime and characters.

Additionally, I had a rough time finding the right keywords to plug in to get the best results.  I kept typing “War on  Drugs” into the search, which gave me a large amount of results.  By adding the keyword “1970s” and putting quotation marks around “War on Drugs,” I was able to narrow down the results to best fit my project.  

### *Reflection*
I had a significantly easier time writing the Grant Narrative because it was about my own project rather than other people’s projects.  I knew what I wanted to do with *Mapping Power of the Dog*, and I just had to put my ideas into words.  However, there is always that second-guessing nature when it comes to writing something you have no experience with.

This is where peer reviews and student examples come in handy.  I like looking at examples because it gives me more of an idea of what my project should look like.  Peer reviews are also helpful because you get another perspective looking at your paper with fresh eyes.  The peer review and student samples were one of the most beneficial tools for me in the class overall.  

### *Conclusion*
Overall, the grant project, TEI code, and reviews helped me understand DH the best.  This grant and TEI code projects showed me the behind-the-scenes of DH because I could see the work going into building a project from gaining funds to building the site.  On the other hand, the review assignments helped me see the end-stages of DH projects: what they should look like and how they can be successful.

I was excited to take this class because I have never done this type of writing before.  As this class comes to an end, I am proud of how much my writing skills have improved and how much I have learned.
