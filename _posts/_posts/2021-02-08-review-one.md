### *Summary* 

*Navigating The Green Book* is a compilation of data from the *Green Books* by Victor Green.  Victor Green was a postal worker who published multiple directories that would later become known as the *Green Book*.  The *Green Book* was a travel guide that listed locations where black travelers would be welcome.  These books were a tool for black travelers necessary for safe navigation.  The project directors’ aim is to promote awareness of the differences in travel based on the color of one’s skin.  This project has two key features based on mapping.  Users can map their own trip with the *Green Books* or view and interact with an overall map of the data. 

### *Design*

This project was created on GitHub using technology such as *Mapbox*, *Leaflet*, and *Open Street Map Nominatim*.   *Mapbox* is used for mapping tiles as well as routing directions.  *Leaflet* allows for the interactive map UI.  These tools work seamlessly to provide the smooth, interactive mapping experience within the project.  NYPL labs extracted data (via OCR) from *The Negro Motorist Green Book:1947*, and then used Scribe framework to correct and normalize it.  Data was also extracted from *The Negro Travelers’ Green Book: Spring 1956*. 

### *Findings*:

The home page is visually pleasing and informative right off the bat.  It is simple yet effective in its visual elements.  The bright text is easy to read and stands out while the images do a good job of making the page less wordy.  The images also feature captions that help people to understand what they are.  The Green Book is immediately defined on the front page.  This is helpful to users who might not be familiar with what it is. 

The two functions of the project are front and center making the page easy to navigate.  Not only that, but the buttons are separated into different boxes with images and descriptions of their function.  

The **“View Map”** button leads to the overall map.  The map has a little box that has a description of The *Green Book* and where and what data was extracted.  Also within this box, the user can navigate back to the Home Page or Map a Trip.  The user can look at two different maps; one is from 1947, while the other is from 1956.  In cluster view, there are different bubbles with numbers.  The map is interactive, and the user can click on the different bubbles zooming into different locations.  Different symbols are used to mark different types of locations: food, lodging, and even liquor.  While the symbols are clear enough, the site could benefit from an overall legend.  I like how the different locations have pictures from the *Green Book* attached as well as the actual name.  The map also features a Heatmap view, which is not as clear.

The **“Map a Trip”** button allows users to map their own trip and see the locations along their travels where black travellers would be accepted.  The user can map a trip using the 1947 or 1956 book.  Unfortunately, the X-out button on this page does not work.  Users must continue with mapping a trip to return to the original page.  The map is virtually the same as the other map.  The red line marking the trip is easy to see.  The sidebar shows the different addresses marked along the line, which allows users to view these locations more clearly.  The locations are marked along the red line by their respective symbol.  This depiction allows users to more clearly see the struggles that black peoples faced during their travels.  The project could be improved if the mileage between the locations was marked on the sidebar.  This could give an emphasis to the struggles they faced with a numerical value.

The map is not as mobile-friendly.  While users can still access the project on their mobile device, the design elements do not load correctly.  Especially on the map, it is much harder to use.  The description box on the map is very large, and it does not/cannot go away.  This box obstructs a large portion of the map.  When mapping a rip, the sidebar gets squished, therefore cutting off addresses.

Overall, the project is very well-designed and informative.  It caters to all audiences regardless of experience-level.  It does a fantastic job showing the struggles that black travelers faced in an informative yet appealing way.  The “Map a Trip” function is especially essential in calling attention to those issues.
